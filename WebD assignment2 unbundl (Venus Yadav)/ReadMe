Provide a brief explanation of your approach, including any tools or
frameworks used, and the reasoning behind your choices

Explaination-

HTML Structure:
The HTML file defines the structure of the page, consisting of two sections: one for displaying available chocolate options (chocolate-options) and another for the custom pack (custom-pack). Each chocolate option is represented by a checkbox and label.

CSS Styling:
The CSS file styles the components to create an intuitive and responsive user interface. It uses flexbox to arrange chocolate options in a grid-like format, and it includes styling for checkboxes, labels, and the overall layout.

JavaScript Functionality:
The JavaScript file is responsible for handling user interactions and updating the UI dynamically.
An event listener is added to the checkbox changes in the chocolate-options section. When a chocolate is selected or deselected, the corresponding data is updated in the selectedChocolates array.
Functions are defined to display the selected chocolates, calculate the total price, and update the item count. These functions are called whenever a change occurs.

Reasoning Behind Choices:

Plain JavaScript:
Used plain JavaScript without any external libraries or frameworks to keep the implementation lightweight and simple. For a small-scale feature like this, using vanilla JavaScript is often sufficient and avoids unnecessary dependencies.

HTML for Structure:
Utilized HTML for structuring the content of the page, as it provides a semantic and clean foundation for the document.

CSS for Styling:
Employed CSS for styling to ensure a visually appealing and responsive design. Flexbox was chosen for its simplicity in creating a flexible layout for the chocolate options.

Event Listeners:
Event listeners are used to capture changes in the state of checkboxes. This approach allows for real-time updates to the selected chocolates, total price, and item count without requiring a page reload.

Array Manipulation:
Utilized arrays (chocolateOptions and selectedChocolates) to store and manage the data. Arrays are versatile data structures that simplify operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing.

Responsive Design:
The design is kept simple and responsive to provide a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
